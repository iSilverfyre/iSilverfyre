# Chapter 1 - Introduction to Ruby
Below is more or less notes to myself for each of the lessons in this chapter.  Some lessons do not have exercises or are not listed here because there was no practice work done in the lesson.

## Introduction to Ruby
This tutorial will introduce you to Ruby, an object-oriented scripting language you can use on its own or as part of the Ruby on Rails web framework.
### 2 - Data Types: Numbers, Strings, Booleans (ex01.rb)
Setting variables using numbers, strings and boolean values
### 3 - Variables (ex02.rb)
Further explination on using variables.  Variables can be changed throughout a script depending on where the variable is set
### 4 - Math (ex03.rb)
Practicing math functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, and modulo)
### 5 - 'puts' and 'print' (ex04.rb)
Practice the differences between 'puts' and 'print'
### 7 - The '.length' Method (ex05.rb)
Counts the length of the attached string.
### 8 - The '.reverse' Method (ex06.rb)
Reverses the string given.
### 9 - '.upcase' & '.downcase' (ex07.rb)
Sets the string to UPPER or lower case depending on method called to the given string.

Adding =begin and =end at the start and end of a comment block allows you to type multiple lines of comments without needing to add # at the start of each line
### 12 - Naming Conventions (ex10.rb)
Proper naming conventions for ruby, symbols like '$' or '@' should be avoided.
### 13 - Variables & Data Types (ex11.rb)
Review of declaring variables and their values.  '"''s are needed around strings but not integers.
### 14 - Math (ex12.rb)
Review of math equations
### 15 - Strings and String Methods (ex13.rb)
Review of strings and the methods in which they can be motified.
### 16 - Comments (ex14.rb)

## Putting the Form in Formatter
Now that you know a little bit of Ruby, let’s put together your first project! In this one, we’ll write a small program that will format a user’s input.
